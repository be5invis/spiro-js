## spiro-js

**spiro-js** is a JavaScript / TypeScript port of [Raph Levien’s Spiro](https://github.com/raphlinus/spiro), an interpolating spline based on spirals, with extended features for per-knot callbacks and quadratic output.

Credits for Spiro to **Raph Levien**, and also to others that translated his work to other programming languages that made my port easier.
